Hatchworks Photo Restoration (HPR) is part of the Hatchworks family of companies.  HPR's goal is to help you preserve your family memories by restoring old and/or damaged photos.  Each restoration includes a 5x7 print and a high resolution digital file.

The cost varies based on the complexity of the restoration but most restorations can be completed for the base price of $30.00\. 

The preferred process is to mail me the damaged photo and I will produce a high resolution scan. I will then edit the image to repair and restore the image. I will post the restored digital image for you to download, and I will mail you the original and a 5x7 print of the restored image. Typical processing time is 1week.
